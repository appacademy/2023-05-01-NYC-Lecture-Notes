## Logistics - Plagiarism 
* We take plagiarism very seriously
* Infractions will result in dismissal from the program

	1. Don't copy: There's a huge difference between referencing and learning from the projects of your predecessors, and just blatantly copying their work
	2. Attribute
	3. Ask

## Logistics - TAs to PAs 
+ Each of you will be assigned a Project Advisor (PA)
+ Your PA will:
	+ regularly review your progress
  + offer guidance and answer questions
  + help hold you accountable to deadlines

## Git Workflow
+ Utilize git and [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
	- Your `main` branch will always be clean and error free
  - Create a new branch whenever you start working on a new feature
  - Do all your development work on the feature branch and only merge it into the `main` branch when it is functional and complete
  - Push the updated `main` branch up to Heroku
