# Whiteboarding Script  

### Overall two demos:
+ Bad interviewee and good interviewer
+ Good interviewee and good interviewer  

### First Demo: Cold Open 
+ Introduce each other

+ Interviewer presents question 
+ Interviewee silently start coding 

+ Interviewer will ask what language is this  
+ Interviewee will cut them off and tell them that they’re thinking 

+ Interviewee will finish the question 

+ Interviewer asks if there are any elements of the input that they have to consider 
+ Interviewee will say no 
+ Interviewer will say what if you received a string 
+ Interviewee will blow interviewer off and say we don’t need to worry about it

+ Interviewer asks any way to optimize
+ Interviewee will respond with no 

### Q and A session 

### Slides where we talk about CREPE
+ Alternate talking about each letter in acronym 
+ Don’t get caught up in making the most efficient
+ People will often worry about making the most efficient code and disregard the obvious when it could give them some points rather than no points. 
+ Maybe you don’t have to write the brute source solution but definitely mention it. 

### Second Demo:

+ This should be very smooth pair don’t really need to write a script for this

+ Introduce yourself 

+ Interviewer presents question 
+ Interviewee will follow CREPE 

+ Interviewer will ask for any opportunities of optimization 
+ Interviewee will discuss we can’t do better and why we can’t do better 

### Pair boarding roles (include what makes a good interviewer and good interviewee)
#### Interviewer 
+ Not giving too many hints as interviewer
+ Be supportive and helpful when they are stuck
+ Do not try to completely change the interviewees approach/ be open to interviewee solution even if it might be different then what you are thinking
### Interviewee
+ Follow CREPE
