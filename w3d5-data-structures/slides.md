## Learning Goals

+ Understand the basics of data structures and in what situations certain data structures might be preferred
+ Know what a `stack`, `queue`, and `tree` are, and basic API to implement them
+ Know how to implement `BFS` and `DFS` for your tree and understand the differences between them

---

## Lecture Agenda

* ADTs VS. Data Structures
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Algorithms and Methods (DFS / BFS)

---

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

`Abstract Data Type`: Defines a set of properties and interactions with some information (i.e. the blueprint)

`Data Structure`: Actual implementation of the concept, with all of the properties (i.e. the building itself)

* Allow passengers to enter and exit vehicle
* Accelerate
* Decelerate
* Direct

## Tradeoffs!

---


## What data structure could we use to implement these ADTs?

* List
* Dictionary

---

## Example: Stacks

---

## Stack (ADT)

Overview: Sequential collection of objects. All operations take place at one end (LIFO).

![Stack](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/08034c7ae610ca661572cf1458e3e36aa5ee5e0d/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e67697068792e636f6d2f6d656469612f336f68687765526773394f5a6c644c7761732f67697068792e676966)

---


### Stack (ADT) -- Sequential, LIFO

**Properties**:

* `push(el)`:  Add element to top of stack
* `pop`: Remove and return element from top of stack
* `peek`:  Return top element of the stack, without removing it
* `size`: Return the current size of the stack
* `empty?`: Return true or false depending on whether or not stack is empty

## Queue (ADT)

Overview: Sequential collection of objects. Removal at one end, insertion at the other (FIFO).

![Queue](https://i.gifer.com/18wK.gif)

---

### Queue (ADT) -- Sequential, FIFO

**Properties:**

* `enqueue(el)`:  Add element to back of queue
* `dequeue`: Remove and return element from front of queue
* `show`:  Show the entire queue (but don't return it! Why wouldn't we want to return it?)
* `size`: Return the current size of the queue
* `empty?`: Return true or false depending on whether or not queue is empty

## Trees

---

## What makes up a Tree ADT

* Composed of nodes that store information
* Each node has (optionally) one parent and (optionally) many children
* Depth

---

## "Do we need a `Tree` class?"

---

## Node

+ The basic unit comprising a tree
+ Typically holds a value and references to its children
+ The root node _is_ the tree (and every other node is a sub-tree).
+ **internal nodes** vs. **leaf nodes**

---

## Is the root node a leaf node or an internal node?

---

Which nodes are leaves?
Which nodes are internal?

## A simple Node implementation

---

## Algorithms & Methods

---

`Algorithm`: General approach and process to problem solving operations (ex. Binary Search)

`Function/Method`: Concrete implementation, in a specific language, of an algorithm (Binary Search in Ruby)

---

## Tree Traversal Algorithms (Search)

* Breadth-first Search (BFS)
* Depth-first Search (DFS)

---
